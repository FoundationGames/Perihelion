## Getting Started
- Find and (if lucky) excavate a gravel patch on the floor of an Old Growth or Jungle biome
- Travel to the sun by walking onto the Singularity Projector below the wooden boards
- Make your way into the base of the icy structure to discover the Solar Sail Boat and Solar Beam block
- Use the boat to sail solar winds from below and travel to the nearby space station
- Travel to farther away space stations; discover sources of silicon crystals to craft more decorative blocks and solar sail boats
